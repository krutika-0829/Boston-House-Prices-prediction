# Boston-House-Prices-prediction
Predict house prices using machine learning.

## Dataset
Source: kaggle(Boston House Prices-Advanced Regression Techniques)
Description: This dataset has total 13 features and target variable("MEDV").I have removed one feature ('B') as it seemed controversial.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation

## Models Used
- Linear Regression

## What did i learn while creating this project
- Understood what each feature really means and this was really helpful to analyze data.
- Learnt how to plot graphs(not much but atleast i started).which made things clear like finding outliers and skewness.
- understood how skewness can lead to biased results and how data tranformation helps.
- Understood what is an outlier
- Feature Scaling and how it works for linear regression

  ## What confused me
  - I had no idea how to deal with outliers. i have little knowledge of undesratnding outlier type so i just decided to ignore them for now.
  - i know how feature scaling works but i expeced it to change  my errors but ther was not even sligest change which really made me think for a sec about feature scaling and i guess i need read more about them and how thwy work with other models.
  - understanding graphs and plots was little difficult for me at first.
  - was difficult to clearly say what shape data distribution has i could rougly recognize skewed data.
  - i had no idea what to do with left skewed data.
